# (Simple) Smite API
## Adam Hochberger

This is a package meant to ease API calls to the Smite Developer API. 

I plan on using this package within a larger-scale
project that can make use of the API by displaying information in a wiki format.


### Todo: 
* ~~Add constant with formatted string names that represent the API requests, so they are directly callable~~
* Add test cases for requests and data validation
* Implement simplistic classes to hold the data (item, god, ability)
* Convert this into a PyPi package
